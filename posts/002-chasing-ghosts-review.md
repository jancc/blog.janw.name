I felt compelled to do a deep dive into the set of slides entitled _THE PFIZER
INOCULATIONS FOR COVID-19: MORE HARM THAN GOOD_. This particular instance of
COVID-19 vaccine critique does not seem nearly as (let's gratiously call it)
farfetched as some of the current counter arguments. But skipping over the
slides still revealed, right at the get go, many small nitpicks that just felt
off. Nevertheless I don't particularly care for Pfizer or BioNtech as
companies. They primarily want to make some quick money and don't act out of
pure philanthropy. As such, they'd gladly walk over corpses to reach that goal.
In fact for _Pfizer_ this isn't really [a
secret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pfizer#Legal_issues). So I don't very
much feel like shilling for them and won't go into this with the aim of
disprooving everything in those slides. Actually, this deep dive happening
purely out of my own interest than anything else. So let's see if we can learn
anything new from [THE PFIZER INOCULATIONS FOR COVID-19: MORE HARM THAN
GOOD](https://www.skirsch.com/covid/MoreHarm.pdf).
